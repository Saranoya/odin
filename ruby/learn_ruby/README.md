# What is this? 

These are my solutions to the exercises found at [The Odin Project's learn_ruby fork](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/learn_ruby). They were a first foray into test-driven learning and development in Ruby, using rake. 

To see the requirements and the associated rake specfile for each exercise listed here, check out the Odin Project's GitHub repo, linked above.
